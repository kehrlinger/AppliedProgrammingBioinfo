# AppliedProgrammingBioinfo
Solutions for the APBI course of Uni Wien

This repository contains almost every exercise from the APB practicum of Uni Wien (SS17).
It is aimed at students who are participating in the LV "2017S 300353-1 Applied programming for Bioinformatics - Principles and techniques for simple programming to solve biological problems, using a common programming language. Practical experience with text processing and automation of external programms".

Since it was completely obscure to me how github actually works when I started out, the folder structure is a little bit messed up.
The scripts in this repo also reflect my experience in coding as the practicum progressed. When I uploaded the files, I thought about rewriting them, but decided against it, simply because it was not worth the time.

Some of the scripts are for linux and others are for windows. Any pull requests with the corresponding versions are welcome.

# Perl
The first six lessons are written in Perl. I was working with Perl on eclipse with the EPIC plug-in.
If I find time I am going to attache some kind of cheat sheet in here, where I list the most common mistakes in Perl.
Same goes for learning resources.
The regex lesson (number four) was done by a friend of mine, therefore I will not upload this here without her consent.
The sixth exercise is about SQL, which I utterly despised. The quality of the script reflects this relationship.

# Python
Exercise seven and eight are written in python, I was using PyCharm for this task.
In addition to the normal exercises I also attached a rewrite of the Perl exercises in python.
These are not required for the course, I just did them for practice and thought if anybody wanted to do the same they would probably appreciate them too.

# Bash
The last exercise deals with bash scripts. I was using either Notepad++ in combination with the "linux for windows subsystem" aka ubuntu for windows. Or KWrite on Fedora 25 KDE, respectively.
