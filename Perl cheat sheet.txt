This file is aimed at people who want to start coding in Perl.
It is comprised of mistakes that came up often during my time of learning this language, and can be used as a general debugging guide.
It is not written in any specific order.

- array index starts at zero
	nuff said

- chomp input:
	After accepting input, either from the user, or text file, it ends in a trailing newline ('\n')
	This can lead to strange behavior during runtime that can be especially hard to identify, since it does not generate a specific error, but throws seemingly random errors upon runtime.
	On the other hand, I also had situations where chomping input (from text file only, if I remember correctly) resulted in an error, but not chomping worked fine.
	While I was never able to determine the cause for this unusual behavior, it should be noted that both variants should be tested when in doubt.

- check parenthesis and brackets
	More than once a script did not work because some kind of bracket, parenthesis or quotation mark was not the one i needed.
	There are multiple guides on the internet for the different rules that apply to those elements. Most of the time these mistakes give a syntax-error in the IDE already.
	
- do not confuse comma and semicolon
	nuff said

- check for typos in variable names

- use the original text file you read from
	This may seem weird, but I have been in a lot of situations where i accidentally changed something in the text file I was working with (e.g.: a FASTA file),
	and suddenly my script gave me strange errors. This does only show during runtime, and most of the time it looked like a problem in a loop, while the loop itself was correct, but the underlying text file was not.
	Very hard to determine as an error source. Good practice: backup your sourcefile before running the script on it, and if in doubt reload the original one.
	
- make sure you are always using the right prefix for the different variables
	$ = scalar
	@ = array
	% = hash
	also note that the prefix changes if you are referring to for example a single element of an array.
